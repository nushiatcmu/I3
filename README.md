Feathr Movie‑Streaming Feature Store Demo

A hands‑on, end‑to‑end example that shows how to use Feathr to build leakage‑free, production‑ready features for a movie‑streaming churn‑prediction model.

The repo demonstrates:

Declarative feature definitions in Python

Automatic point‑in‑time joins for offline training datasets

Turn‑key online serving backed by Redis

CI/CD hooks (GitHub Actions) and observability with Prometheus/Grafana

Cloud‑agnostic deployment—flip a single flag to run the same code on local Spark, Databricks, EMR, or Snowflake
